Create a mature, premium, respectful website dedicated to Guru Tegh Bahadur Ji.
The entire website text must be written in pure Gurmukhi Punjabi, but the numbers will remain normal (like 1621, 1675, etc.).
The website must look spiritual, calm, and historically rich — like a digital museum, not a kids’ site.
Build the following sections:

1. Home Page (Introduction + Moral)

Hero section with a respectful image of Guru Tegh Bahadur Ji

Title in Gurmukhi Punjabi, for example:
“ਸ਼੍ਰੀ ਗੁਰੂ ਤੇਗ ਬਹਾਦੁਰ ਜੀ — ਧਰਮ ਤੇ ਮਨੁੱਖੀ ਅਧਿਕਾਰਾਂ ਦੇ ਰਖਿਆਕਰਤਾ”

Overview of the website written in Gurmukhi

Section for the moral, teachings, and message of Guru Sahib (Gurmukhi text)

Highlighted quote in Gurmukhi:
“ਕਾਹੂ ਕਉ ਦੇਤੁ ਨ ਡਰੈ, ਨਾਹੁ ਡਰਾਵੈ।”

2. Biography Section (With Left Timeline Panel)

Full, detailed biography written entirely in Gurmukhi Punjabi

On the left side, add a fixed vertical timeline titled “ਵਿਸ਼ੇਸ਼ ਤਰੀਖਾਂ”

Timeline entries should use normal numbers like this:

1621 – ਜਨਮ

1635 – ਕਰਤਾਰਪੁਰ ਦੀ ਲੜਾਈ

1664 – ਗੁਰਤਾ ਗੱਦੀ

1665–1675 – ਉਦੇਸੀ ਯਾਤਰਾ

1675 – ਸ਼ਹੀਦੀ

When a date is clicked, the page should scroll to that detailed part of the biography.

3. Shabad / Bani / Raag Section

All Shabads written by Guru Tegh Bahadur Ji in pure Gurmukhi

Meanings explained in Gurmukhi Punjabi

Add Prof. Sahib Singh Ji’s Gurmukhi teeka/explanation

Provide an audio player to listen to Shabad, Raag, and explanations

Include Raag details in Gurmukhi:

Raag name

4. Gurudwara Sahib Section

Display all historic Gurudwaras connected to the life of Guru Tegh Bahadur Ji

Each Gurudwara card must contain:
